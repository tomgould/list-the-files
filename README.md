==============

I originaly thought this would be a nice way of opening media in Chromecast but the browser tab casting is not ideal for watching video but this is still useful to me so I have one place to check where I am and what I have in relation to the series and films I watch.

This provides a page where I can look at all of the episodes and films I have so I don't have to use a file explorer.

I made this to work on Windows, it probably works on Unix but I havent tested it.
